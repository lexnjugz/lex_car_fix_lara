                                <p>No! Forget all about that old myth. As long as you follow the specifications given by the manufacturer (which can be found in your handy owner’s manual), your warranty is valid. At Car Repair Service, we always follow the manufacturer’s maintenance schedule. We’ll make sure your warranty remains valid and your car remains happy - for many miles to come!</p>

Your timing belt should be changed every 50,000-70,000 miles, however every manufacturer is different. You should consult your owner’s manual to determine the correct replacement interval.</p>

                                <p>The average driver uses their brakes 75,000 times per year and takes for granted that they’ll work every time. Today’s brake systems are hydraulic and use brake fluid which is hydrophilic, meaning it can absorb moisture from the air. Once the hydraulic system has moisture in it, corrosion takes place and brake components fail. Brake fluid should be flushed periodically to keep corrosion under control. This procedure is not expensive and is included in many preventative maintenance schedules. Brake fluid should be handled with care. It will melt plastics and remove paint.</p>

                                <p>Antifreeze should be replaced every two years due to oxidation and deterioration of important additives. These additives lubricate the water pump and protect metal parts from rust and oxidation. They also help keep coolant hoses soft and flexible. Today we can recycle and clean old antifreeze, replacing the additives. Antifreeze is very toxic and not environmentally friendly so recycling makes good sense. The engine’s thermostat should also be replaced every 2 years to keep the engine operating temperatures in the proper range.</p>
